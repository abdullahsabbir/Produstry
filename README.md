A Responsive website converted from a PSD.

This is a website that I made for practice purposes. It was converted from a PSD provided by my mentor Mr. Sajal Sarder. I tried to make it as responsive as possible. I can't say it's 100% bugless, but it works pretty well.

Note that I've worked only on the Front-end of this Website. Not the Back-end.
